# Problem Description
# Our NFL database was created as a representation of a database that would aid the leaders or administrators of the football league to make critical, impactful decisions about the league, and facilitate management. It is comprised of key categories of information including the stadium, game, team, players, head coach, and tickets. The NFL is one of the biggest players in a huge sports and entertainment industry, and there is a huge amount of data that needs to be organized, managed, and utilized. Sports leagues constantly undergo change in response to unfair treatment of players, unfair exploitation of rules by players and teams, or changing tastes of consumers. With our database, the league managers and its committees can interpret information to make informed decisions for the integrity, sustainability, and profitability of the league, and handle the tasks they are responsible for, including creating or changing rules, approve ownership changes, train game officials, integrate technology, ensure competitive balance, and maintain legitimacy and entertainment of the game.
